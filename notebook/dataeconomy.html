	 <p>I recently went on a trip through Thailand and Cambodia. I learned a lot of things and had a lot of fun but one thing really stuck with me throughout and just would not let go of my mind:</p><p>Khao San Road had a data economy.</p><p>It started with my wife and I heading toward the area. She had visited it several years ago and thought I might enjoy it. I also needed to pick up some clothes I had forgotten to bring, so it was a bit of a win-win.</p><p>For those who don’t know: Khao San Road is a street in Bangkok, Thailand that is well known among backpackers. It has a lot of cool vendors. From what I’ve been told it used to be more “natural” and have a lot of very unique shops but these days it has a lot of the same generic t-shirt and clothing shops, a few tattoo parlours and a bunch of custom suit makers.</p><p>We started our walk a good distance away from the street and, like almost every street we walked by during the trip, we were accosted by tuk-tuks and street peddlers the entire way there. For the most part they were just yelling the word “tuk tuk” and making motorcycle movements with their hands.</p><p>With the shear amount of people doing this, visitors quickly learn to ignore them — making any sort of noise toward them can encourage them to pester you an insane amount.</p><p>That’s when one of them asked what country we were from. He didn’t really ask casually — he yelled it at us as we walked by.</p><p>Taken aback we yelled out Canada!</p><p>He smiled and said “Toronto” but we had gotten too far and didn’t respond.</p><p>This happened about a block away from the main drag of Khao San Road. What happened when we finally got onto the street blew me away:</p><p>Sales people, who knew maybe 10 words of English at most, all started yelling: “Mr. Canada!” at me.</p><p>I was not wearing a Canadian flag on my bag or any other obvious indicators of where I was from. Throughout most of the trip people had assumed I was American.</p><p>I’m not talking about a few people either: every vendor somehow knew I was Canadian and even started throwing in city names (“Montreal? Vancouver!”) to try and get my attention.</p><p>Even after we had gone to a bar and had a few drinks, once we got out they continued calling me that.</p><p>My assumption is that the tuk tuk driver who accosted me (I’m starting to think the tuk tuk was just a prop) had some kind of What’s App list and any data he got on people walking by would be shared to people on that list.</p><p>My assumption went a bit further in that he probably charged for that piece of data. Kind of like how we charge for any kind of data we have on people.</p><p>By having a piece of data on me the sales person has a way of getting my attention when other sales people couldn’t. It was a leg up. As I said before: travelers automatically ignore sales people after a while, having that data about where they are from can get a sales person past that initial block and into a possible sale.</p><p>The value of that data would be decided by the “tuk tuk” driver and the sales people, a natural economy.</p><p>Or maybe they all just guessed correctly on the first go. Canada is a pretty big country!</p><p>I do wonder how he described me. Did he share a photo or just call me the fat bearded white guy.</p>
