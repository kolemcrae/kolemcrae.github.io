	<p> Current consulting capacity: <strong>Available.</p></strong>
		
<p>Startups and small businesses have two things they can spend: time and money. Both of those resources are extremely tight. </p>

<p>My job is to make sure that every dollar and hour you spend on digital marketing gets you the highest return possible. </p>

<p>I've been doing this for over a decade now and have helped companies go from 2 person teams to global phenoms. </p>
	<h2>Some Testimonials</h2><br />
	<blockquote> "Kole was able to run a thorough review of our site, and gave a detailed and practical report, with thoughtful insights and recommendations that we're now able to work on. In the world of SEO where a non-expert can easily be hoodwinked, he's a really trustworthy partner. Thanks Kole!"</blockquote>
	<p> - Alexandra Lamb - <strong>Co-Founder and CEO - <a href="https://boldly.app/">Boldly</a>a></p></strong><br />
<blockquote> "Kole is a Google genius.  He is an exceptionally skilled professional with a deep understanding of Google's ecosystem. His ability to swiftly address challenges is truly remarkable, often resolving issues within mere minutes. His analytical prowess allows him to identify and rectify gaps in anyone's strategy with a level of expertise that is truly exceptional. Remarkably, Kole's knowledge of Google products surpasses that of even some Google employeesâ€”a testament to his unparalleled mastery in the field. (I can attest to this from my frequent interactions with Google personnel in the past.)"</blockquote>

<h3> The Complete Engine - My Recommendation!</h3>
<p>SEO, CRO, Analytics, Strategy</p>

<p>I'll help you build an engine that will get you results for years to come. </p>

<p>Maybe you've worked with an agency, maybe you got advice from trusted sources, maybe you spent weeks learning as much as you could about digital marketing but you just aren't getting the results you need. 
</p>
<p>That's where I come in. 
</p>
<p>Instead of telling you how to get more likes on Facebook or what your brand should feel like, I analyze every part of your business and website with an eye for pure performance. 
</p>
<p><strong>What I will look at:</strong> </p>
	<ul>
<li>Does your website convert? is it easy for people to buy your product or service? You'd be surprised the things you don't realize are stopping people from spending money
</li>
		<li>Do you know what people do on your website? Do you know where they came from and which source is making you the most money? Do you know what's making people close the tab and never open your site again?
</li>
		<li>Can you track if a specific headline in an ad made you more money than another one? </li>
<li>Where do your ideal customers actually look for help and hang out? </li>
<li>Are you testing different messaging?</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
<li>Full SEO audit including a technical audit, keyword strategy, content strategy and more</li>

<li>Full audit of your web analytics tool</li>
<li>One meeting for each of the above audits to go over them in detail</li>
	</ul>
	

<p>The strategy will outline next steps for all of the above in detail. </p>

<p>Getting traffic to your website is tough, turning that into sales is also tough, I make sure you can do both at the highest level of efficiency. </p>

<p>You are not required to have been doing any SEO, CRO or analytics work ahead of this audit.</p>
